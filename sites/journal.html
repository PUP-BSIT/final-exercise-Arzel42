                        <strong>End of The Beginnings (12/31/2023)</strong>

                        <p class="poem">
                            Beneath the shade of midnight's embrace,
                            A year departs, leaving its trace.
                            In the book of time, a chapter ends,
                            Yet, a new one starts, with lessons to transcend.
                        
                            The canvas blank, an unwritten story,
                            New beginnings bathed in the dawn's glory.
                            The tapestry of memories, both old and new,
                            A mosaic of experiences, a kaleidoscope view.
                        
                            In the garden of challenges, seeds of growth,
                            Each trial faced, a testament to both
                            Resilience and courage, blooming in the heart,
                            A symphony of lessons, a work of art.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph"> 
                            As we welcome the new year, I can't help but look 
                            back on my college days. Remembering the mix of 
                            good and not-so-good times, it feels like a 
                            journey through different worlds. College has 
                            been a time of both challenges and carefree
                            moments.
                            
                            <em>Late-night studying, facing tough exams, and 
                            celebrating small victories with friends have 
                            all been part of this adventure. These 
                            experiences have shaped me, making me more 
                            resilient and determined.</em>
                            
                            But there's also a sense of nostalgia for 
                            the days when money wasn't a worry, and time
                            seemed endless. I miss the simplicity of those 
                            times. Now, standing on the brink of the future,
                            I feel a bit uncertain but excited.
                            
                            The upcoming transition from college to adulthood
                            feels like a big step. It's a bit scary, but 
                            it's also a chance for growth and new discoveries.
                            I'm realizing that time is precious, and I'm
                            at a crossroads between looking back and
                            looking forward.
                            
                            The memories, whether they bring a smile 
                            or a lesson, are coming along with me into 
                            the new year. They're like a guide,
                            helping me navigate the unknown path that 
                            lies ahead. Here's to stepping into the next 
                            chapter with the lessons learned
                            and the hope for new adventures.
