        	<h2>My interest and hobbies</h2>
        	<ul>
        		<li><strong>Reading Books</strong></li>
        			<p>The act of reading books goes beyond being just a 
                        mere hobby; it is an immersive experience that 
                        takes us on adventures to diverse realms and 
                        exposes us to various viewpoints. Books possess 
                        the extraordinary ability to transport us to 
                        unexplored territories and introduce characters 
                        who quickly become our companions for life. 
        				Whether I'm engrossed in the intricate twists 
                        and turns of a thrilling mystery or absorbing 
                        new knowledge from a profound non-fiction 
                        piece, reading perpetually brings me immense
                         delight and continuous growth.</p>
        		<li><strong>Playing Mobile Games</strong></li>
        			<p>Mobile games provide a delightful and engaging
                        way to momentarily detach from the demands of
                        everyday life. They offer a valuable opportunity
                        for leisure and stimulation, allowing me to 
                        exercise my strategic thinking or reflexes, 
                        depending on the game. Whether I'm engrossed
                        in solving puzzles, embarking on thrilling 
                        adventures through fantastical realms, or 
                        engaging in friendly competition with companions,
                        gaming serves as an excellent avenue to unwind 
                        and foster connections in this ever-evolving 
                        digital era.</p>
        		<li><strong>Watching Anime</strong></li>
        			<p>Anime goes beyond being a mere form of entertainment.
                        It is a medium that has the power to deeply touch 
                        our hearts and souls. With its vibrant characters,
                        compelling storytelling, and distinctive art 
                        styles, anime offers an immersive experience that
                        is difficult to replicate elsewhere. Whether 
                        it's delving into the complexities of human 
                        emotions through drama or embarking on exhilarating
                        adventures in fantasy series, anime holds 
                        a special place in my heart.
                    </p>
        		<li><strong>Creating a Daily Planner</strong></li>
        			<p>Creating a daily planner goes beyond simply 
                        organizing tasks. It's an opportunity to take 
                        charge of my time and prioritize effectively. 
                        By using a well-designed planner, I can set goals,
                        stay focused, and maximize each day's potential.
                        Ultimately, it serves as a valuable tool for 
                        accomplishing my aspirations while maintaining 
                        a healthy balance between work and personal life.</p>
        		<li><strong>Drinking Coffee</strong></li>
        			<p>For me, its is more than just a drink. It's a special
                        ritual that jumpstarts my day. The strong scent
                        and robust taste awaken my senses and give me the 
                        energy and concentration I need to face any obstacles 
                        that come my way. Whether it's savoring a quiet moment 
                        of contemplation or enjoying the company of friends, 
        				coffee is like a warm and comforting companion in my
        				life.</p>
